The [API monitor](http://www.rohitab.com/apimonitor) speaks for itself. It's a great tool for the system API calls debugging, monitoring, information extraction, exploring. Especially in cases when you don't know how exactly API works.

# Goals

**Goals:**

* Explain how to deal with cases when existing API definitions is not enough.
* Show on the example how debug custom DLLs and how to write a definitions for them.

**Non-goals:**

* Write the *"ultimate"* guide to the `API Monitor`.
* Describe how the `API Monitor` works under the hood.
