I bet you know but I still wanna recall it. [`Clap`](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap) is a full-featured, fast Command Line Argument Parser for Rust. [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/). [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/clap).

# Goals

**Goals:**

* Show non-standard examples of the cli arguments.
* Tell you about alternate ways to parse cli args with the `clap`.

**Non-goals:**

* Write the *"ultimate"* guide to the `clap` library.
* Create an introduction (or for newbies) article about the clap.

The current article is basically recipes. It means, here we have described concrete problems, ways how to solve them, and examples of the execution.
