I am Pavlo Myroniuk 👨‍💻, a software developer from Ukraine 🇺🇦. Loves Rust 🦀 and open-source software.

This is my blog. Here I usually post some learning materials, guides/tips, and thoughts about something.
I didn't set a purpose to tell you everything I know. My motivation is to tell about the unusual parts of the experience and explain some topics I consider not described enough on the Internet.

If you enjoy my articles and consider them useful, then just follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/TheBestTvarynka) and star the corresponding repo.

* 💻 I force electrons to do the math 💪
* 🦀 Let's rewrite all in Rust 🥺
* 💚 Workout is a very important part of my daily routine 🏃‍♂️
* 📔 If you have any questions, notes, ideas, feel free to contact me 💬
